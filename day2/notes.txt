datatypes
char - 1 byte
int - 4 bytes
double - 8 bytes
note : by default these data are signed i.e. MSB is signed bit
float - 4 bytes (by default stores 6 digits of precision)
manipulators - 
1. the one that changes sign (signed, unsigned)
2. the one that changes size (short, long)
note: by default int is long int
thus, int is long int and also signed long int
short int is 2 bytes
long long int is 8 bytes
key words - 
for, while, do (loops)
switch, case, default (to implement choosing between the options)
if, else (to implement binary condition)
break (to take the control out of the block)
continue (to skip remaining instructions of current interation and continue with the next iteration)
return (to return the control back to the caller(calling function)). Alternatively we can return a value also.
struct, union, enum (to create user defined datatypes)
static (to create a global variable with file scope and to create a local variable with life till end of the program)
void (to mention that the function does not return a value)
extern (to use an external variable(global variable declared in some other file))
const (to create a read-only variable)

operators-
arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
all are binary operators (which requires two operands)
i/p are numbers, o/p is number
evaluated from left to right (associtivity)
in x+y-z, x+y is evaluated first
the + and - lesser precedence or priority
the associtivity is over-riden by the precedence of operators
Ex: in the x-y%z y%z is evaluated first
in every operation datatypes of the of the operands must be same
infix notation is used
the evaluation of any arithmetic expression writen in infix notation is first converted into postfix and then evaluated
relational operators:
